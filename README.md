# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Through-Deep-Representation-Learning
This project was developed for the course of Numerical Analysis For Machine Learnig for the MSc. in Mathematical Engineering at Politecnico di Milano, A.Y. 2023/2024.

## Description
It addresses the development of a stable credit card fraud detection model that performs feature selection, data balancing and deep representation learning. It is based on the work presented in the paper titled "An intelligent approach for anomaly detection in credit card data using Bat optimization algorithm".
